# Questions:

    -   modularize CICD runners and containers
the problem is that each container is independent in env thus dependency issue

    -   Clang-tidy false-positive flagged

    -   gcov setup
I enter an infinite halt when installing certain dependencies

    -   Definition of good interface and implementation separation and modularization

    -   Makefile: what exactly are they, why are they everywhere
